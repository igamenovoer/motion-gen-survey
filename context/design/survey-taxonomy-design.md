# Survey Taxonomy Design

## HEADER
- **Purpose**: Categorization framework for motion generation research papers and techniques
- **Status**: Draft
- **Date**: 2025-09-01
- **Dependencies**: Literature analysis and domain expertise
- **Target**: Research analysts and survey curators

## Taxonomy Structure

### Primary Categories

1. **Approach Type**
   - Physics-based simulation
   - Data-driven methods
   - Neural/deep learning approaches
   - Hybrid techniques
   - Rule-based systems

2. **Motion Domain**
   - Human locomotion (walking, running, jumping)
   - Upper body movements (gesturing, manipulation)
   - Full-body activities (sports, dance, daily activities)
   - Facial animation and expressions
   - Hand and finger articulation

3. **Application Context**
   - Character animation (games, films)
   - Robotics and control
   - Virtual reality and simulation
   - Medical and rehabilitation
   - Sports analysis and training

4. **Technical Framework**
   - Generative models (VAE, GAN, diffusion)
   - Reinforcement learning
   - Imitation learning
   - Optimization-based methods
   - Kinematic and dynamic modeling

### Secondary Attributes

- **Real-time Capability** (Yes/No/Approximate)
- **Data Requirements** (Large dataset/Small dataset/No training data)
- **Controllability** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Output Quality** (Naturalness, diversity, accuracy)
- **Evaluation Metrics** (Quantitative/Qualitative/Both)

### Metadata Fields

- Publication year and venue
- Code availability
- Dataset requirements
- Computational requirements
- Comparison baselines
- Evaluation protocols

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Manual categorization of seed papers (50-100 papers)
2. **Phase 2**: Refinement based on categorization challenges
3. **Phase 3**: Semi-automated tagging for remaining papers
4. **Phase 4**: Validation and consistency checking

## Success Criteria

- Clear, non-overlapping categories
- Consistent application across diverse papers
- Useful for comparative analysis
- Extensible for future research
