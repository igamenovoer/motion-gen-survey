# Context Directory

## HEADER
- **Purpose**: Centralized knowledge base for AI-assisted development of motion generation survey
- **Status**: Active
- **Date**: 2025-09-01
- **Dependencies**: .magic-context submodule
- **Target**: AI assistants and project collaborators

## Overview

This directory serves as the primary knowledge repository for the motion generation survey project. It follows the standardized context directory pattern from magic-context to organize project knowledge, track progress, and maintain development history.

## Structure

- `design/` - Technical specifications, architecture, and survey structure design
- `hints/` - How-to guides and troubleshooting tips for motion generation research
- `instructions/` - Reusable prompt snippets and command templates
- `logs/` - Development session records and research outcomes
- `plans/` - Implementation roadmaps and survey organization strategies
- `refcode/` - Reference implementations and example code patterns
- `roles/` - Role-based AI contexts for specialized expertise areas
- `summaries/` - Knowledge base and analysis documents for motion generation field
- `tasks/` - Current and planned work items organized by type
- `tools/` - Custom development utilities and research tools

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains specific documentation and context for that area. All files follow the HEADER format with Purpose, Status, Date, Dependencies, and Target fields.

## Navigation

Start with the relevant role directory for specialized AI assistance, or browse task directories for current work items. Use the summaries directory for consolidated research findings.
